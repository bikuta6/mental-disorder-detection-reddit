       "'Hello fellow friends 😄\\n\\nI\\'m on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.\\n\\nThere are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What\\'s a healthy way you found to cool it down?\\n\\nFor me I will first become silent and blame myself, \"maybe if I\" or \"If I only\", \"maybe he\\'s just not having it today\", \"maybe I simply don\\'t get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding\". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don\\'t know whether you guys get to experience this as well? \\n\\nI have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:\\n\\n\"The maximum amount of rage. it\\'s like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It\\'s the point people don\\'t recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It\\'s disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn\\'t even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she\\'s completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I\\'m shaking as I\\'m writing this because I know it\\'s still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone\\'s life. I\\'m extremely grateful for the fact that I didn\\'t, but I know I shouldn\\'t see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he\\'s using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn\\'t get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don\\'t work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.\"\\n\\nTo put things in perspective: Normally I\\'m a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should \"stand up for myself more.\"\\n\\nSo yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: \"There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What\\'s a healthy way you found to cool it down?\"'"

       "       'Cold rage? Hello fellow friends   I\\'m on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.  There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What\\'s a healthy way you found to cool it down?  For me I will first become silent and blame myself, \"maybe if I\" or \"If I only\", \"maybe he\\'s just not having it today\", \"maybe I simply don\\'t get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding\". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don\\'t know whether you guys get to experience this as well?   I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:  \"The maximum amount of rage. it\\'s like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It\\'s the point people don\\'t recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It\\'s disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn\\'t even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she\\'s completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I\\'m shaking as I\\'m writing this because I know it\\'s still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone\\'s life. I\\'m extremely grateful for the fact that I didn\\'t, but I know I shouldn\\'t see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he\\'s using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn\\'t get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don\\'t work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.\"  To put things in perspective: Normally I\\'m a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should \"stand up for myself more.\"  So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: \"There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What\\'s a healthy way you found to cool it down?\"',\n",

       "       'Cold rage? Hello fellow friends   I\\'m on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.  There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What\\'s a healthy way you found to cool it down?  For me I will first become silent and blame myself, \"maybe if I\" or \"If I only\", \"maybe he\\'s just not having it today\", \"maybe I simply don\\'t get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding\". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don\\'t know whether you guys get to experience this as well?   I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:  \"The maximum amount of rage. it\\'s like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It\\'s the point people don\\'t recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It\\'s disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn\\'t even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she\\'s completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I\\'m shaking as I\\'m writing this because I know it\\'s still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone\\'s life. I\\'m extremely grateful for the fact that I didn\\'t, but I know I shouldn\\'t see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he\\'s using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn\\'t get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don\\'t work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.\"  To put things in perspective: Normally I\\'m a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should \"stand up for myself more.\"  So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: \"There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What\\'s a healthy way you found to cool it down?\"',\n",
       "       'I don’t know who I am My [F20] bf [M20] told me today (after I said “I just wish I could be better for you”) that he likes me for who I am, and that I don’t need to be better for him. And after crying about how I don’t think anyone has ever said that to me before, I realized that I don’t know who I am. I know my name, I know my age, I know my school and my hair colour and my weight and my shoe size, but I don’t know any qualitative. I don’t have a favourite meal, or a favourite movie, I don’t know what hobbies I have anymore, or what I’d like in a partner, or my favourite restaurant. I don’t know when I lost myself, or if this is even related to my bpd, but has anyone else experienced this? Am I alone?',\n",
       "       'HELP! Opinions! Advice! Okay, I’m about to open up about many things I’ve done in my past that I’m not proud of. I’m not that person anymore. In these stories I was 17 and immature as fuck. I’m now 22 with a total different take on life.  I became best friends with this girl in 2017. We were both 17 at the time. We did everything together. We smoked weed daily. Sleepovers. Longboard together. Did acid together. We did everything together. We would die for each other.  Once we robbed our mutual friends house. We stole $200 from the girls dad. I ended up telling the girl and paid her back Bc I felt bad.   Once we robbed a building and made out with $1,500 and never got caught.  Once we robbed a house we thought was someone we knew who just robbed us. Turned out it was a fake address he gave us and we robbed a random house. We never got caught.  Once we got arrested for robbing cars off acid while drunk. We caught some fines for that.   We did a lot of sneaky bad shit together. After the last time we got caught, we stopped doing all that shit. We were doing really well.   Long story short this is how our friendship ended.  I was dating a super toxic dude and she’d tell me to leave him all the time. Finally I left him. We went to a party and had a fucking blast. The next day I went home and sent her this whole long text about how her and her bf were toxic and that they should break up.   She didn’t take that lightly. I don’t blame her I wasn’t nice about it and it came out of no where. We were literally fine the day before.  I ended up switching schools and she started rumors that I wanted to break them up because I wanted her boyfriend and he told everyone I tried to kiss him. Not true. He didn’t like me because she spent more time with me than him and he voiced that all the time.  Then I got with my current boyfriend HERE IT IS... I got my boyfriend to rob her house. I specifically said he could only take weed related things. No money and can’t steal from her mom. So he took two bongs and 8gs of weed. She assumed it was me right away Bc who else knew her window didn’t shut. I finally admitted to her like 5/6 months later during our graduation. When I told her, it looked like she wanted to kill me but she kept her cool on the outside.  Let’s call my best friend that I had my bf rob - Katrina Let’s call the girl Katrina and I robbed $200 from her parents - Yazra  Yazra wasn’t mad at Katrina or Me for robbing her parents. She accepted out apology. Yazra invited me and Katrina to her graduation party. We both show up and there I gave Katrina $300 to make up for what I had robbed. She didn’t seem happy. I don’t blame her.   It’s been 5ish years since 2017 when we were best friends. We are friends on Facebook but we don’t talk.   Last week I shared a post that says “if you were ever my closet friend at one point just know I think about you from time to time and hope you’re doing great things in life” and she heart reacted my post  4 days ago I saw her at the liquor store. She was right behind me in line. I was consumed in anxiety and couldn’t even bring myself to say hi or even look at her. When we first saw each other we both looked shook and then quickly looked/walked away. She also said nothing.   I really really want to be her friend again. I cry over her all the time. I vent about her in my journals. I write letters that I think I would one day send to her but never do.   Do you think she forgave me?  Do you think she misses me?  Do you think she could give me a chance again?  Do you think she’s even capable of trusting me again?  Don’t you think she could forgive me after everything we did to other people?  Do you think I should try to message her?  I apologized 100 times back in 2018 during graduation and at the graduation party and repaid her.  What should I say if I do message her?  I really don’t want to never message her and move on from her. She’s really special to me. I love her a lot. She was the best friend I ever had besides all the bad stuff we did. I know we are both grown up now and we wouldn’t do any more stupid reckless shit if we were friends again.   Help. I’m a wreck.',\n",
       "       'My ex got diagnosed with BPD Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.  We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we’ve been on and it’s genuinely felt like we’re rebuilding a meaningful connection again.  She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.  Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she’s getting back on track again - and I’m willing to support her through all of this.  She’s asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she’s ready, so that’s why I’ve come here to update this subreddit.  Anyone willing to share any experiences or give any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks',\n",
       "       'Is misdiagnosis of BPD common? I am asking because I was diagnosed a few years back, but I do not think I have it (Reposting here on the larger sub on recommendation of people from the smaller sub)  I am not sure how common my story is, but I think it\\'s more common than I would think.  I was a problem child for a lot of my childhood in school, but began to improve in middle school. I was very bad with people all my life and everyone who meets me ends up disliking me (this is not an exaggeration, this is unfortunately quite literally the case). This caused me to be a very homebound child and I grew very, very attached to my family. I was academically rather successful in HS, but socially the same. College was an unmitigated disaster for me and at the urging of someone I \"saw someone\". The last time I was evaluated was for autism and ADHD in elementary school and was given a clean bill of health, so to speak.  After two days of talking to someone, the psychiatrist said she believed I had BPD. I heard of the condition before, but I was taken aback and after several sessions asked if she stood by her assessment and she said yes (she claimed to have a bit of experience working with people with personality disorders). After our sessions ended (I saw her in secret), that was kind of it.  I began reading about BPD more and more and the more I read, the less I saw myself in the condition. Yes, I have huge issues with impulse control and have pretty dire self inflicted issues with my health. I am very clingy to people because of the fact everyone I have ever known has run away from me. I have a limited sense of self, to a certain extent, and have huge problems being alone without anyone with me.   But otherwise, it just doesnt click all that much. I am not suicidal, I am not driven to make rash sudden decisions that screw up my life, I am not the kind of person who would quit a job just because I want to curse out my boss (I am pretty good at holding my tongue when there is something in it for me). I wouldn\\'t say I have emotional dysregulation. I know mood swings are the calling card of the condition, and I cant say I have mood swings.   I know you have to meet 5 of 9 criteria. I would say I meet 3 of them like a glove, 4 if we are being generous, and 5 if we are playing fast and loose. And that is just to meet the lowest threshold of the condition.   This happened a few years ago, and I havent followed up on it, but the problems in my life havent gone away.   I figure that I have to wrestle with whether or not I was misdiagnosed to make progress on that front. Is it a thing to be misdiagnosed? Is this a condition like ADHD, where it\\'s over applied? I am a guy, if it makes any difference.  Thanks a lot, everyone',\n",
       "       'I have trouble identifying my sexual orientation because my BPD likes having an identity. I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex’s because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?   A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.   I label myself as queer now because I don’t know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category. I wish I didn’t have so many identity issues so that I wasn’t so worried about this/may be able to understand myself easier and not struggle so much with my identity.',\n",
       "       'Needing advice… I posted on this sub earlier today about having trouble believing my boyfriend even loves me. We are literally moving into a house together and he always reassures me so I know he does…you can look at my post history to see it.   Anyway, I spiraled and got drunk out of anxiety. I went into his facebook page and went YEARS deep and found pics and posts and comments with an ex from literally so long ago. We are both 22, and he was like 16 in these posts. But I saw his family interacting with her and saying how much they love her like they do to me now, and I have broken down. I am sobbing and hysterical and so upset. I know it’s irrational but I am a mess right now.   I feel like I have been flying off the BPD handle lately. I am never NOT freaking out about something. I guess my question is, should I mention this? I feel like I shouldn’t because it’s my issue, and not his. He also didn’t do anything wrong, this is from YEARS ago. I just now can’t get it out of my head that his whole family is just tolerating me at best, and I am just meaningless. I hate that he has had exes because … I don’t know why. I do, too. But thinking about how he was with other women before makes me sick.   I honestly don’t know what else to add to this post because I am just freaking out. Any advice is appreciated. I probably will delete this later.',\n",
